# ⚡ Smart EV Charger – Charge Smarter, Not Harder

##  Overview
This project is a smart and affordable Electric Vehicle (EV) charger designed to help EV owners charge their vehicles at the best possible time. It uses an intelligent energy management system to analyse electricity rates, grid load, and user preferences to automatically schedule charging during off-peak hours. This helps save energy costs and reduce strain on the power grid.

##  Key Features
